## Summary
Alias is a project that aims to empower artists by allowing them to train and monetize their own generative AI models based on their artistic styles. The core concept is for artists to upload their artworks to the Alias platform, which will process the data to create a "LORA" (low-rank adaptation) model that can be prompted to generate new artworks in the artist's style.

Artists can then choose to keep the model private or publish it on Alias, enabling others to explore and generate artworks using the artist's trained model. Published models can be monetized through NFT minting of generated artworks at prices set by the artist, or by selling licenses for different use cases like personal/commercial use.

The key value propositions are giving artists control over how their styles are used with generative AI, providing a new revenue stream from model outputs, and facilitating deeper audience engagement by allowing them to directly interact with and prompt the artist's "alias". Alias also aims to integrate with galleries, enabling them to host and sponsor specific artist aliases.

While still a work-in-progress, Alias presents a novel paradigm for artists to embrace and profit from generative AI technology rather than feeling threatened by it. However, challenges exist around developing user-friendly tools, ensuring accurate style representation in model outputs, gaining adoption, and navigating legal/ethical implications.
