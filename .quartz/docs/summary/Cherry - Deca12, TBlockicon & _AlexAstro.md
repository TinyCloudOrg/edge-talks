## Summary
Cherry is a peer-to-peer collaboration platform presented at Edge City Lanna. It aims to solve the challenge of finding suitable teammates and project ideas for hackathons by providing a Tinder-like interface to match collaborators based on skills, interests, and availability.

The core concept is a mobile app with a Tinder-style swiping interface to match potential collaborators. Once matched, users can chat, share project ideas, and even make micropayments within the app using blockchain technology like Celo and Mantle.

A key innovation is the integration of decentralized identity solutions like WorldCoin and Talent Protocol to build trust and verify skills/experience. The app also utilizes Request Network for facilitating micropayments between collaborators.

The project was built during a previous hackathon and received positive feedback. At Edge City, the team is iterating on the concept, adding features like Privy Social login and expanding blockchain integrations. A live demo showcased the basic swiping, matching, chat and payment request functionality.

While still early stage, Cherry aims to streamline the process of ideating and assembling teams for hackathons and collaborative projects by leveraging blockchain for payments and identity verification.
