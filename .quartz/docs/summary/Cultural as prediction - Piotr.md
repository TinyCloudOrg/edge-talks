## Summary
- The presentation examines culture from a psychological and neuroscientific perspective, proposing that culture can be understood as the collective habits and behaviors of individuals in a society.
- It explores how different psychological traits influence political views and how cultures need to appeal to diverse personality types to become widespread.
- The predictive coding model of perception from neuroscience is presented, suggesting the brain constantly makes predictions and updates mental models based on perception errors. Optimal learning occurs with around 20% unpredicted information.
- Cultures are proposed to have an ideal future state they shift towards, with predictions of large societal changes fostering group identity and urgency. However, failed predictions can lead to phenomena like cargo cults.
- A "culture building recipe" is outlined, involving: 1) An inspiring vision of the future, 2) Grounding in realistic evidence, 3) Urgency to take action, 4) Group practices creating shared identity.
- Real-world applications relate to understanding cultural evolution, designing resilient communities, and shaping narratives for societal change.

## Key Takeaways
- Culture can be viewed through the lens of collective habits shaped by psychological traits
- The predictive coding model suggests optimal cultural narratives allow around 20% unpredicted information for continued learning and evolution
- Widespread cultures need inspiring visions of the future grounded in evidence, a sense of urgency, and practices building shared identity
- Failed cultural predictions can lead to problematic phenomena like cargo cults
- Interdisciplinary perspectives from psychology and neuroscience offer novel insights into the dynamics of cultural change
- Designing resilient communities involves carefully curating collective narratives and practices
