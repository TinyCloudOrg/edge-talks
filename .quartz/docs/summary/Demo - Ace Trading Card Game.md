## Summary
Ace is a physical trading card game that serves as a canvas for collective creativity, allowing players to design their own cards and shape the narratives around Web3 lore and mythology. Developed by Colton, a former character artist at Sony and creative director at Gitcoin, Ace aims to make Web3 concepts more accessible and engaging through gamification and storytelling.

With around 200 cards currently in the game, players can collect and play with cards featuring iconic Web3 characters and stories, such as Satoshi's Spirit, the playful Doge, and the formidable FTX Titanic. The game encourages players to bring their own creative visions to life by designing new cards that excite both players and collectors.

Ace has been launched at various events, including ZooZaloo, ZooConnect, and the upcoming DevCon, where the first tournament is planned. The game has evolved through multiple alpha versions, with cards being sold out at events, indicating interest and engagement from the community.

Colton shared his creative process, showcasing artworks inspired by Edge City's residencies and demonstrating how game outcomes can be turned into animated shorts and new cards. He emphasized the power of storytelling in connecting people with cutting-edge technology and envisioning a brighter future.
