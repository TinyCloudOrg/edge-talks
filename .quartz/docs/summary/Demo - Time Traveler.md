## Summary
Time Traveler is a simple web application that allows users to quickly convert between time zones for distributed teams. The speaker, addressing a common challenge of coordinating across time zones, developed this tool in a single day as a side project to solve their own problem.

The core concept is straightforward - users can enter a time and see the equivalent times for their team members in different zones. The interface is designed to be intuitive with no explanation needed, adhering to good UX principles. Users can swap time zones with a single click.

While not a groundbreaking technical innovation, Time Traveler demonstrates rapid prototyping and practical problem-solving for a real-world remote work scenario. The speaker considers it their first successfully completed project at Edge City Lanna and plans to share a larger endeavor the following week.
