## Summary
- The presentation explores the emergence of non-territorial forms of sovereignty in Europe, driven by factors like climate change, wars, political persecution, and the need for economic competitiveness.
- It discusses two key examples: 1) The use of blockchain-based voting by the Belarusian diaspora to hold alternative elections and issue digital passports for a "New Belarus" network state. 2) The proposed creation of a "28th regime" - a virtual EU member state with harmonized rules to foster innovation and competitiveness.
- Technical innovations like blockchain voting apps (Vocdoni, Freedom Tools/Rarimo), digital identity solutions, and virtual registries are highlighted as enabling tools.
- Key challenges include achieving recognition from nation-states, navigating regulatory frameworks, and ensuring security/legitimacy of decentralized systems.
- The presenter shares insights from ongoing projects, campaigns, and policy discussions around these concepts within the EU.
