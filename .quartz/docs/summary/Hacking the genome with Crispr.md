## Summary
The speaker, Kathy, is a biotech entrepreneur aiming to make gene editing technology like CRISPR more accessible and decentralized through "network state" community labs. She provides background on the rapidly declining costs of genome sequencing and editing, enabling a wave of innovation beyond medicine into areas like agriculture, environmental applications, and even the creation of novel organisms.

Kathy proposes setting up an independent lab at the Edge City Lanna event to demonstrate the relative simplicity of gene editing. The hands-on workshop will involve taking genes that produce red pigmentation from beets and using a bacterial vector to insert them into the genome of a plant, causing the plant's leaves to turn red over the following days.

The goal is to demystify biotechnology, provide participants with direct experience in gene editing techniques, and spark creative ideas for further applications of this powerful tool outside of institutional constraints. Kathy envisions a future of decentralized, community-driven bio-innovation benefiting from diverse environments and perspectives.

## Key Takeaways
- Gene editing using CRISPR has become relatively simple and inexpensive, enabling a wide range of applications beyond medicine
- Setting up decentralized "network state" community labs can democratize biotechnology and drive innovation from diverse environments
- Hands-on demonstration showed the straightforward process of genetically modifying a plant to produce novel traits like red pigmentation
- Increased accessibility of biotechnology tools like CRISPR raises ethical concerns around modifying organisms that may require new governance models
- Creative applications of gene editing are possible, from agriculture optimization to designing novel organisms like "unicorns"
- Directly engaging communities with biotechnology can reshape incentives and shift the traditional model of academic research and monopolistic drug development

## Speakers
- Kathy: Biotech/healthcare entrepreneur, previously founded companies in genomics space, currently working on gene editing project. Demonstrated expertise in biotechnology entrepreneurship and hands-on genetic engineering.
- Leo: Assisted Kathy in preparing materials and sourcing plants for the gene editing workshop.
