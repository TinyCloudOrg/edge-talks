# Network Nations - Group Discussion Summary

## Overview
Watch panel [here](https://streameth.org/edge_city/watch?session=671b23639da0f165b839b3ec)

## Summary
This panel discussion explored concepts around "network nations" - interconnected communities with some degree of functional sovereignty, organized as nodes in a decentralized network rather than traditional nation-states. Key topics included:

- Examples of bottom-up networking between autonomous zones/communities to increase resilience, like refugee support networks or the zones in Honduras 
- Use of emerging technologies like blockchain and new legal vehicles to instantiate sovereignty outside nation-state system
- Challenges in designing governance that promotes solidarity vs corporate extraction 
- Building legitimacy and gaining widespread support across diverse cultural contexts

The panelists proposed network nations as a more adaptive alternative to the rigid Westphalian nation-state model, with a flexible mesh of self-governing nodes bound by mutual recognition and shared values rather than centralized authority. However, many open questions remain around the optimal structures, achieving legitimacy, and scaling these experiments into a true parallel system.

## Key Takeaways
- Bottom-up networking of autonomous zones/communities through mutual recognition and shared values could increase sovereignty and resilience
- Blockchain, crypto and new legal vehicles enable instantiation of functional sovereignty outside nation-state system
- Designing governance focused on solidarity vs. extraction is crucial - the "vehicle" shapes the trajectory
- Building trust, legitimacy and widespread support across cultures is key to scaling these models
- Real-world examples like refugee networks, blockchain communities and zones like Prospera demonstrate potential but also challenges
- An open question remains around optimal governance structures that are robust and aligned with network nation principles
