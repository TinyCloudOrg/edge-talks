## Summary
Nico Shi** Art is an XR artist with a background in game development and a passion for exploring the intersection of art, ecology, and technology. In this presentation, Nico shares their work in creating virtual worlds and their research into solarpunk communities that aim to harmoniously integrate nature and technology.

The main project discussed is a VR game that allows users to bring elements from nature (plants and animals) into a virtual space and turn them into musical instruments, creating a cohesive ecosystem with a cohesive soundscape. The goal is to merge interests in nature, solarpunk ideologies, music, and XR into a single interactive experience.

Nico demonstrates a prototype of the VR game, showcasing how users can select plants from an archive and transform them into sequencers with different sounds. The project aims to integrate with Monaverse, a platform for 3D NFTs, allowing users to import 3D assets as musical instruments within the game.

The presentation highlights the potential for using virtual reality and game engines to explore and promote sustainable living concepts, while also creating unique artistic and musical experiences. It addresses the challenge of bridging the gap between real-world ecological communities and imaginative virtual worlds.
