## Summary
This was the opening presentation for a hackathon at Edge City Lanna focused on building "Tools for Human Flourishing." The core themes were decentralization, AI/ML, defi, social applications, and "deshitification" - giving users more privacy and agency over their data.

Various sponsors presented bounty tracks with prize pools totaling $60k. World (formerly Worldcoin) offered prizes for using their decentralized identity protocol WorldID or building apps using their World App. MetaMask had a delegation framework for frictionless crypto applications. Arbitrum highlighted their alternative smart contract language Stylus for compute-heavy apps. Flow wanted decentralized social apps for mainstream users. Uniswap and Eigenlayer offered prizes for novel defi apps and decentralized networks respectively.

The "deshitification" track, run by a residency program, emphasized building open-source, privacy-preserving tech that avoids extractive data practices. Examples included peer-to-peer networks and verification using third-party data signatures.

Key implementation details were shared on using sponsor tools, and the hackathon structure of judging criteria, submission process, and demo day was outlined. The focus was on delivering concrete, usable projects aligned with the core themes.

## Key Takeaways
