## Summary
Edge City Lanna is a month-long popup village focused on accelerating innovation across human organization, AI, crypto, health/longevity, and hard tech. This community demo day showcased a variety of projects being built and experimented with at the event.

Key innovations included decentralized file storage using Filecoin, with demos from Ghost Drive, Akave, and eStore showing browser-based uploading and streaming from the decentralized web. A reputation system called Karma was presented, allowing on-chain signaling of trust/reputation. The Circavum project demonstrated a 3D calendar interface for visualizing schedules. Cursive Connections showcased a novel social app using NFC wristbands and "digital pheromones" for privacy-preserving matchmaking at events.

Other notable projects included an interactive Tensions game for designing future "holographic cities", an NFT art project called Inktober, a funding platform for public goods called Propel, and a game about the trials of founding a startup. Unique solutions were proposed for challenges like secure data storage, visualizing complex schedules, facilitating new connections, and bootstrapping incentives for collaboration.
