## Summary
The speaker, Yoseph from Borderless Africa, discusses the potential of using local stablecoins in African countries to reduce reliance on the US dollar and facilitate economic activity. He highlights the growing use of stablecoins and crypto in Africa, driven by utility needs like cheaper cross-border payments and integration into the global economy.

A key proposal is issuing local stablecoins backed by government bonds or other assets, using them as a unit of account rather than a medium of exchange. This could enable value transfer between countries without directly using US dollars, except for trade imbalances. Implementation would involve creating liquidity pools with local stablecoin pairs and distributing through existing and new payment rails.

The main problems addressed are US dollar shortages, currency instability, inefficient cross-border payments, and lack of access to financial services in the informal economy which makes up a large part of African economies. Local stablecoins could provide programmable money, automated forex, and cheaper transactions compared to current systems.

Key challenges include scalability, decentralization, trust in issuers, and regulatory compliance. The speaker advocates for an approach that enhances local economic sovereignty, aligns with user incentives, and interoperates with existing systems. Some experiments with over-collateralized local stablecoins and lending programs are mentioned.
