## Summary
Brink Lindsey, a vice president at a Washington D.C. think tank, presents his perspective on the transition from material prosperity to widespread human flourishing as "the permanent problem" facing modern societies. He defines flourishing in terms of realizing human potential through relationships, projects, and experiences.

Lindsey argues that while capitalism has been tremendously successful in creating material wealth, it now faces challenges in sustaining economic dynamism (declining productivity growth) and fostering social inclusion (rising inequality, alienation, mental distress). He attributes this to the expanding logics of consumerism and managerialism which tend to outsource human needs to impersonal market/bureaucratic systems.

To address this, Lindsey proposes revitalizing capitalism to drive continued technological progress towards a radically wealthier future where more people can engage in self-directed pursuits. In parallel, he calls for redesigning social systems to re-enable vital interpersonal connections and meaningful projects aligned with human nature. This could involve lower living costs, more leisure time, and a "custodial" relationship with the environment.

Ultimately, Lindsey argues that while economic and technological advancement creates opportunities for flourishing, individuals and communities must actively construct environments conducive to authentic relationships and self-realization. Collective flourishing requires balancing dynamism (exploration, change) with inclusion (belonging, meaning).

## Key Takeaways
- Modern capitalist societies face challenges in sustaining economic dynamism (declining productivity growth) and social inclusion (inequality, alienation, declining community ties)
- Human flourishing requires a balance of relationships, self-directed projects, and meaningful experiences - which markets/bureaucracies tend to outsource
- Revitalizing technological progress through capitalism could radically increase societal wealth, enabling more self-directed pursuits
- In parallel, social systems need redesign to re-enable community, belonging, and projects aligned with human nature
- Potential pathways include lower living costs, more leisure, custodial relationship with environment
- Both dynamism (exploration) and inclusion (belonging) are required for collective human flourishing
- Individuals and communities must actively construct environments conducive to self-realization alongside economic/technological progress
