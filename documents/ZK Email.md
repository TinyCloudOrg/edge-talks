## Summary
The presentation discusses ZK Email (ZKE), a platform that enables zero-knowledge proofs for email interactions. Key features include:

- A registry for easily defining new ZK proof patterns for email interactions in 2 minutes
- Automatic creation of ZK proofs that allow verifying email send/receive while keeping content private
- Demo of a QR code proving a rejected Devcon talk, granting access to a partner event
- Redesigned website and production deployment
- Solidity library for seamlessly integrating ZKE proofs into smart contracts
- Exploration of decentralized "Sign in with Google" using JWT keys
- Account recovery product for adding email-based guardians to wallets like Klave and Safe
- Collaboration with Noir team for faster client-side proofs
- Plans to conduct a workshop on defining new ZKE proofs

The core innovation is using zero-knowledge proofs to enable private and verifiable email interactions, with applications in authentication, account recovery, and smart contract integrations. A key focus is making ZKE easily accessible through developer tools and seamless user experiences.
