## Summary
ZKP2P is building a decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace using zero-knowledge proofs and secure multi-party computation to enable trading of digital goods like tickets across existing web2 platforms. The core motivation is that current centralized platforms extract excessive value from users, lock in their data, and provide poor user experiences.

ZKP2P's approach leverages cryptographic techniques like ZK-SNARKs and trusted execution environments to allow users to prove ownership of digital assets from web2 platforms and trade them directly in a decentralized manner. This avoids platform monopolies while giving users full data ownership and portability.

A key demonstration is a live decentralized ticket resale marketplace at tickets.zkp2p.xyz with no fraud, low fees, and fast settlement times enabled by smart contracts. This tackles major issues in the ticketing industry around high fees, fraud, and unreliable user experiences from centralized resellers like Stubhub.

While sourcing data from web2 platforms and driving user adoption remain challenges, the project showcases innovative applications of cryptography to disrupt data silos and platform monopolies across digital economies.
