## Summary
The speaker presents their vision for creating an interactive, immersive virtual reality experience in the form of a computer game or "metaverse" environment. They have been developing digital sculptures, characters, and assets as NFTs to fund this project, exploring the representation of "ugly" and dangerous aspects of nature often overlooked in existing metaverse aesthetics.

Key technical concepts include:

- Creating 3D sculptural environments that can function as virtual meeting spaces
- Incorporating AI agency and unpredictable elements into digital artworks
- Exploring novel metaverse aesthetics inspired by carnivorous plants, deep sea creatures, etc.
- Utilizing new AR/VR hardware like Apple Vision Pro for dynamic, environment-reflecting 3D model creation

The speaker aims to develop a workflow for creating hand-painted, optimized 3D sculptures that can scale between desktop objects and immersive virtual environments. They plan to create a collection inspired by their experience at Edge City, experimenting with the boundaries between physical and virtual spaces.
