## Summary
Cursive is exploring how cryptography can be used to foster human connections through a series of experiments culminating in the Cursive Connections app demonstrated at Edge City Lanna. The app utilizes NFC wristbands to securely collect digital signatures when people meet, visualizing these connections as a "flower garden". By leveraging private set intersection, users can discover common interests while preserving privacy. Novel features like "narrowcasting" allow users to signal availability for activities or hiring, getting matched when mutual interests align.

The "super connector" concept enables introductions between people with overlapping goals through an intermediary who has met both parties. Narrowcasting requests have adjustable visibility, requiring consent before revealing identities. Multiple NFC devices can represent different personas across communities.

While still evolving, the app aims to facilitate meaningful in-person connections through serendipitous matching using privacy-preserving cryptography. Early demos show visualizations of users' social graphs and matching based on static traits, with planned expansions to real-time activity coordination and hiring.
