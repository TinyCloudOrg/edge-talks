## Summary
Introverted is a party game designed specifically for introverts, aimed at facilitating genuine connections and conversations through a unique set of prompts and gameplay mechanics. The game revolves around six distinct archetypes (Intuitor, Connector, Conjurer, Enhancer, Specialist, and Transmuter), each with its own skills, affinities, and special powers.

The game consists of 120 prompts and games divided into three levels of increasing depth, aligned with the different archetypes. Players choose an archetype and navigate through the levels, engaging in activities and discussions tailored to their chosen persona. This approach encourages participants to explore different aspects of their personalities and connect with others on a deeper level.

Introverted has been developed through extensive playtesting in various communities, events, and festivals, allowing the creators to curate a diverse range of prompts and games. The game has recently been produced in its first physical print run of 100 copies.

While the game aims to facilitate meaningful connections for introverts, the creators acknowledge challenges in marketing and promoting their physical product effectively. They are actively seeking advice and guidance from those with experience in marketing physical products.
