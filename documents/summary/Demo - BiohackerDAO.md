## Summary
The speaker introduces BiohackerDAO, a tokenized biohacker collective aiming to facilitate health optimization experiments during the Edge City Lanna event. The core idea is to leverage the gathering to conduct a group experiment involving lifestyle interventions and biomarker tracking.

Participants will take two blood tests, one at the start and another 2-3 weeks later, to measure the impact of chosen interventions like fasting, exercise, or sauna use. An app will also estimate biological age shifts. The goal is to demonstrate how relatively simple protocols can positively influence health markers over a short period.

The speaker shares personal results showing significant biological age reduction across metrics like telomere length through long-term lifestyle changes. While ambitious multi-year protocols are an option, the Edge City experiment aims to showcase achievable progress during the event's timeframe.

Logistical details are provided on signing up, an info session, and coordinated blood tests. The DAO uses blockchain tokens, though their role is unclear. Overall, it's an innovative citizen science approach to collaborative biohacking.

## Key Takeaways
