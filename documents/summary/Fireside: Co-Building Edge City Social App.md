## Summary
This fireside chat explored the vision for building a decentralized social app tailored to the needs of the Edge City community during their month-long gathering in Chiang Mai. Edge City aims to accelerate human flourishing through experimental technology and social innovation.

Key concepts discussed included leveraging blockchain infrastructure like Flow to enable seamless user experiences and scalability for next-generation social apps. The goal is to move beyond the unhealthy dynamics of current mainstream social media toward tools that facilitate productive community engagement, voice sharing, group coordination, and serendipitous connections.

A unique aspect is the immersive format, allowing participants to rapidly prototype concepts using Edge City as a living laboratory, gathering real-time feedback from the diverse global participants. Potential technical challenges include designing intuitive decentralized architectures, while social challenges involve fostering genuine connection aligned with human flourishing values amidst rapid technological change.

The hackathon presents an opportunity to develop a minimum viable social app product with the potential for future support from Edge City, Flow Foundation, and other partners. Speakers emphasized removing constraints and dreaming ambitiously about defining new paradigms for decentralized social experiences.
