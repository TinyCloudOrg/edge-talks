## Summary
This panel discussion introduces the concept of "network nations" as an alternative governance model to traditional nation-states and market systems. Network nations are envisioned as interdependent online/offline communities united by shared values, culture and aspirations rather than territorial boundaries. They leverage decentralized technologies to enable new forms of self-governance, service provision, and collective action across domains like education, healthcare and environmental stewardship.

The core idea is for civil society to develop functional sovereignty - the ability to govern its own affairs without external interference - by organizing through a network nation framework. This could allow better coordination on global challenges that states and markets struggle with due to competing interests. Key features discussed include collective identity, subsidiarity (decision-making at most local level), interdependence rather than unilateral "exit", and commons-based models as an alternative to state/market dichotomy.

While conceptual, the panel explores how network nations could be a more adaptive, participatory model of "nation-building" attuned to digital communities and transnational dynamics. However, technical and social challenges exist around decentralized governance mechanisms, developing shared culture/values, and gaining recognition as legitimate actors.

## Key Takeaways
