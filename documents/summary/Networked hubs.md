## Summary
- The presenters propose using hotels and resorts as "living labs" to test interventions from behavioral science aimed at promoting human flourishing through habit formation and environmental design.
- They argue that while we have scientific insights into drivers of well-being, there is a lack of practical applications translating this into people's daily lives and behaviors. Hotels provide an opportunity to design spaces that "sneakily" cue good habits and run experiments testing interventions.
- Specific examples are given such as games to build connections, environmental cues to prompt desired behaviors, and measuring the impact through data collection and guest surveys.
- The presenters run a resort in Thailand and intend to implement some of these ideas, while acknowledging the challenges in measuring impact and creating lasting behavior change from interventions.
- Overall, they see hotels as unique controlled environments to better understand human flourishing through combining technology, environmental design, data collection, and insights from behavioral science.

## Key Takeaways
- Using hotels/resorts as "living labs" to test behavioral interventions and collect data on human flourishing is a novel idea proposed.
- Designing physical spaces to subtly cue desired habits/behaviors through environmental psychology principles.
- Combining technology, data collection, environmental design, and behavioral science insights to understand drivers of human well-being.
- Implementing "sneaky" interventions that operate on a subconscious level may be more effective than conscious efforts for lasting habit change.
- Measuring impact and running rigorous experiments on behavioral interventions remains a key challenge to overcome.
- The presenters intend to pilot some of these concepts at their resort, providing an opportunity for real-world implementation and refinement of the ideas.

## Speakers
- Ting - Behavioral scientist, demonstrated expertise in applying behavioral science to product design for habit formation and well-being.
- Adam - Ting's co-presenter, expertise unclear but involved in proposing and testing the "living lab" hotel concept.
