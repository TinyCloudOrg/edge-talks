## Summary
Dr. Jan Gruber presented on using the nematode worm C. elegans as a model for studying aging and identifying potential anti-aging interventions. C. elegans was the first organism where single gene mutations were found to significantly extend lifespan, suggesting regulated aging pathways exist. Over 600 compounds have now been identified that can extend lifespan in model organisms like worms and flies.

Gruber's lab uses automated screening systems to test drug combinations in high-throughput on C. elegans, enabling analysis of millions of images tracking changes over the lifespan. They find some drug combinations like rapamycin+metformin can nearly double median lifespan when administered to adult worms.

A key insight is modeling aging as a degradation of the organism's "physiological state" over time, represented as a multi-dimensional landscape. Cumulative damage reduces the barriers separating the normal state from disease "attractor" states, leading to an exponential increase in mortality risk. This potentially explains why interventions affecting specific processes like oxidation have limited impact.

By analyzing high-dimensional data like transcriptomics, Gruber finds a primary "aging" component describing the trajectory towards the failure attractor state. This trajectory is conserved across species and potentially represents the global aging process to target. However, mapping the specific biological mechanisms underlying this landscape remains a challenge.

## Key Takeaways
- C. elegans is a powerful model for identifying conserved aging pathways and screening anti-aging compounds using automated systems
- Some drug combinations like rapamycin+metformin produce striking lifespan extension, suggesting potential for translation
- Aging can be modeled as declining "physiological state" separating the normal condition from failure attractors
- An primary "aging trajectory" exists in high-dimensional data, potentially representing the global process
- Mapping specific mechanisms underlying this trajectory is key for developing effective interventions
- Automated screening combined with machine learning/dimensionality reduction enables novel insights
- Stochastic damage may dominate over genetics/lifestyle in extreme longevity cases
