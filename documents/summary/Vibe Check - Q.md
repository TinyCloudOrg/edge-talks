## Summary
- The speaker, Q (Chandresa), is an Albanian web developer and open-source enthusiast attending the Edge City Lanna residency.
- Q shared a personal story about creating a "mood board" to non-verbally communicate her feelings while recovering from dental surgery.
- Inspired by this experience, Q built a decentralized application (dApp) for Edge City residents to mint NFTs representing their daily mood/vibe.
- The dApp aims to provide an expressive outlet, especially for mental health, while experimenting with blockchain technology.
- As part of an Ethereum Foundation scholarship, Q is researching developer experience with Layer 2 solutions, making this a practical implementation to gather insights.
- The project is open-source, allowing community members to contribute feature suggestions and participate in the development process.
- Key technical components include minting NFTs on the blockchain to represent moods and a user interface for selecting and sharing those mood NFTs.
