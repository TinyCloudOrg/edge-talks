# Transcript Analysis Prompt

## Context for Analysis
Edge City Lanna is a month-long popup village in Chiang Mai, Thailand (Oct-Nov 2024) focused on accelerating human flourishing through experimental technology and social innovation. Key themes include:

- Human Organization (education, cities, governance)
- Artificial Intelligence (compute, alignment, practical applications)
- Real-world Crypto (practical applications, protocol research)
- Health/Longevity/Bio (neurotech, nutrition, biohacking)
- Hard Tech (geoengineering, nanotech, space)

The transcript provided is from an event at Edge City.

## Analysis Structure
Process provided transcripts and generate structured XML summaries following this format:

<transcript_analysis>
    <thinking>
        Consider:
        - What core innovations or insights are presented?
        - What specific problems are addressed?
        - What unique approaches are proposed?
        - How does this connect to real-world implementation?
        - What technical or social challenges exist?
        - What experiments or results are shared?
    </thinking>

Guidelines:

1. Content Focus (85%)
   - Prioritize actual technical/social content
   - Extract specific methodologies
   - Document concrete examples

2. Contextual Integration (15%)
   - Include relevant experimental context
   - Note collaborative opportunities
   - Consider scaling potential

3. Speaker Attribution
   - Maintain technical accuracy
   - Preserve key insights
   - Note significant interactions


The analysis should be immediately useful to practitioners while acknowledging the experimental context when relevant to understanding or implementing the ideas presented.
